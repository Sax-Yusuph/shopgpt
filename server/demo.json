While these are mostly solid in color, there may be subtle plant markings from the dyeing process, an unpredictable characteristic as unique and beautiful as nature itself. </strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong><strong>CARE</strong><span> </span>/ Hand washing is preferred, but you can wash in the washing machine on a delicate cycle in a mesh bag. Be sure to use chemical-free, pH-neutral laundry soap (we use Seventh Generation). Do not use chemical detergents; they can alter natural hues. Wash on a cold and <meta charset=\"utf-8\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">delicate </span>cycle. After washing, delicately squeeze out water without twisting or wringing. To absorb remaining moisture, roll it in a towel and press out extra water, then lay it flat or hang it to dry. Use the silk setting on your iron or medium heat if ironing is needed. Prolonged exposure to direct sunlight can fade natural hues. </p>","published_at":"2023-09-06T19:31:17-04:00","created_at":"2023-09-06T19:31:17-04:00","updated_at":"2023-10-02T11:44:33-04:00","vendor":"Silk &

Be sure to use chemical-free, pH-neutral laundry soap (we use Seventh Generation), as harsh chemical <meta charset=\"utf-8\">detergents can alter natural hues. Wash on a cold and gentle cycle. </h6>\n<h6>Keep your silk scarf looking its best longer by paying attention to how you dry it! After washing, delicately squeeze out water without twisting or wringing. To absorb remaining moisture, roll it in a towel and press out extra water, then lay it flat or hang it to dry for optimal results; alternatively, putting it on low heat setting in the dryer will quickly dry your silk- just be sure not to over-dry as shrinkage may occur. For perfect drying each time, try tumbling on low heat, 10 minutes at a time, checking every interval until it's just done - this will avoid wrinkles with no need for ironing afterward! If ironing is needed, use the silk setting on your iron or medium heat and iron on the back side of the silk (the side with the Silk &amp; Willow logo).<br>\n</h6>\n<h6>Note / Prolonged exposure to direct sunlight can fade botanical hues.

With a base hue of golden yellow and flower markings of yellow gold, burnt orange, and amber.</p>\n<p>The flower markings are seen throughout. Marigolds run down the center while Snow Chrysanthemum are sprinkles along the edges. The botanical prints create a continuous natural pattern across the silk.</p>\n<p>Layered over a solid table cover, the botanicals appear more vibrant. As a single layer, it creates a sheer layer of floral prints on your table. Use to style on dinner tables, entry tables, wedding cake tables, grazing tables, or for styling your flatlay photography.</p>\n<p><strong>Each Sheer Silk Table Runner is one-of-a-kind. </strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>Comes lightly ironed and folded in a keepsake organic gossamer silk bag.</strong> </em></p>\n<p>Iron on medium heat or your irons \"silk setting\", steam, or spritz with water to remove fold creases. <br></p>\n<h6>\n<strong>Approx.

Be sure to use chemical-free, pH-neutral laundry soap (we use Seventh Generation), as harsh chemical <meta charset=\"utf-8\">detergents can alter natural hues. Wash on a cold and gentle cycle. </h6>\n<h6>Keep your silk scarf looking its best longer by paying attention to how you dry it! After washing, delicately squeeze out water without twisting or wringing. To absorb remaining moisture, roll it in a towel and press out extra water, then lay it flat or hang it to dry for optimal results; alternatively, putting it on low heat setting in the dryer will quickly dry your silk- just be sure not to over-dry as shrinkage may occur. For perfect drying each time, try tumbling on low heat, 10 minutes at a time, checking every interval until it's just done - this will avoid wrinkles with no need for ironing afterward!

This is perfect for last-minute projects! Due to the deckled edging, this paper does not fit in a standard 8 ½ x 11-inch tray; when using it in the printer, you will need to cut or tear ¼ -½ inch off one edge to feed through your printer as an 8 ½ x 11 sheet. All printing pictured is printed with an HP Color LaserJet Pro M452nw.</h6>\n<h6 data-mce-fragment=\"1\">DISCLAIMER | We take no responsibility for paper or printing issues due to using this paper in
